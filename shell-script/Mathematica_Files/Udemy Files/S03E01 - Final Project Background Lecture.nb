that presented a serious limitation. Darwin was aware of this limitation, and \

In order to explain the process of natural selection, there needs to be a \
model or theory for explaining heredity and inheritance. That is, we need to \
understand how the traits of parents are passed on to their offspring. At the \
time when Darwin was developing his theory of evolution by natural selection, \
the prevailing theory of inheritance was one of equal blending of the traits \
of the two parents. Meaning, the offspring inherits a uniform mixing of \
traits of its two parents, similar to mixing paint. Remember, this was before \
we knew about genes and how heredity in general worked. Darwin knew that this \
theory had limitations, and in his book he mentioned that the laws of \
inheritance are \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]quite unknown\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. \
As Livio explains, Darwin even understood that if such a process were to be \
the governing principle for inheritance, then after each generation, traits \
of ancestors would become completely \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]diluted\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], and yet in real life we constantly see evidence to \
the contrary. Characteristics of ancestors can appear in further generations \
down the line, which would never happen under the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]blending\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] theory. Despite this \
fact, Darwin still expected Natural Selection to work. \

The first person to show experimentally that traits of living organisms are \
passed down through a mechanism other than blending was Mendel. He did this \
using pea plants. Crossing a purple flower with a white flower produced a \
purple flower, which could be explained using blending theory. However, he \
then crossed the new purple flowers by themselves, and found that a white \
flower showed up in a quarter of the offspring. This was a clear indication \
that information from parents cannot simply be mixing and that somehow the \
information about the white color had been passed on through generations \
without changing. For a more detailed explanation of Mendelian genetics have \
