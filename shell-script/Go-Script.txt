Run your first Go program by executing:
go run hello.go

If you wish to compile it and move it to $GOPATH/bin, then run:
go install hello.go

You can create Go package, as well importing shared ones. To do so you'll need to use go get command
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux

Go has a tool that automatically formats Go source code.
gofmt -w yourcode.go
go fmt path/to/your/package

Using the godoc command, you can generate a program documentation.
godoc fmt                # documentation for package fmt
godoc fmt Printf         # documentation for fmt.Printf
godoc -src fmt           # fmt package interface in Go source form
