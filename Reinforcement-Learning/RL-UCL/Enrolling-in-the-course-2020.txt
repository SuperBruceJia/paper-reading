The course enrolment is capped so that we can give all the students a quality learning experience. If you are not already enrolled, then you may still be able to, but you need to obtain special permission from the instructor (me, Rich Sutton). To do that, you should come to my office on Thursday, January 2, anytime between 2 and 5pm. Based on a brief talk then I will assess your knowledge of Part I of the textbook and of other subjects which are prerequisites for the course. I should be able to tell you right away if you can enrol.
