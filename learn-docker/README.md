# learn-docker
This repo is mainly for my personal learning of Docker

I will upload my own study commands later when I'm available.

## Model Deployment

Some of my deep learning models have been uploaded to [my Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/shuyuej).

The ***MedicalNER: Deploy PyTorch NER Model with Flask and Docker as Web App*** project can be found [here](https://github.com/SuperBruceJia/pytorch-flask-deploy-webapp).
